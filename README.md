# Deep Q-Learning for Atari Boxing

## Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play the Atari Boxing game using Stable Baselines3 and Gymnasium. The solution includes:
- A training script (`train.py`) that compares MLP vs CNN policies and performs hyperparameter tuning
- A playing script (`play.py`) that loads the trained model and demonstrates gameplay
- Comprehensive documentation of the training process and results

## Implementation

### Understanding of DQN and RL Concepts
Our implementation demonstrates:
- Proper handling of exploration-exploitation tradeoff using ε-greedy policy
- Experience replay buffer for training stability
- Target network implementation to prevent oscillation
- Frame stacking to capture temporal information

### Hyperparameter Tuning
We tested multiple configurations and documented results:
